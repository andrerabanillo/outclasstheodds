## What Is Arbitrage Betting?

**Arbitrage betting is the strategy of placing bets on every possible outcome of a sporting event using different sportsbooks to guarantee a profit, no matter who wins.

This works because sportsbooks sometimes disagree on their odds.  
When the disagreement is large enough, you can distribute your bets such that:

- Outcome A → you profit  
- Outcome B → you profit  
- Outcome C (if applicable) → you profit  

For example, a bettor can place one bet on a team to win at **Book A**, and another bet on the same team to lose at **Book B**, as long as the combined implied probabilities are under 100%.
